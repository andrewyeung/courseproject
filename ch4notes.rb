=begin
= is used for giving "assignment" to the "variables"
*variable name needed to be lowercase letter for the first chracter
*don't quote the variable
We assign an !!!object!!! to the "variable", we can reassign another object. We call them variables becoz it varies!
Assign (using =) is a way of pointing, not really eqaul to = in algebra!
So, var1 =8
var2 = var1
var1 = 'eight'
*****puts var2 # => 8 
=end
